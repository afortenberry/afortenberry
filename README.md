<h1>Hi, I'm Alvin!
With 9 years of experience in IT, I am now re-entering the field with a focused shift toward Cyber Security. After taking a year to fully immerse myself in entrepreneurship by building and expanding my own Mobile Gaming business, I am excited to transition my expertise and passion into the Cyber Security space. As I return to the tech industry, I am eager to apply my diverse IT background and broaden my skills in this critical and fast-evolving field. </h1>
